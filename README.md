# SpeedArchive
Very simple tool for locally archiving leaderboard data from the speedrun.com API.

[1] Enter a game name or ID, and that game will be added to the backup list. A 'Backup' folder will be created in the same folder as the executable and all backups will be stored there.  
[2] Enter your username or ID, and all games that YOU run will be backed up.  
[3] Checks all games you've ever backed up, and creates new backups if there are new runs.  
[4] Tells you the last time a specific game was backed up.   
[5] Deletes the backup list.
